This is a playground for learning and playing with docker swarm in the new 1.12RC2 version of Docker.


As of June 30th, this installs Docker 1.12RC2 and gets it setup with 2 nodes and 1 master, by just running Vagrant up.   
 Once vagrant finishes it's run vagrant ssh master-1, and the cluster is ready to go!
