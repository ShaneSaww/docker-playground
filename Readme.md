This is a playground for learning and playing with docker swarm in the new 1.12RC2 version of Docker.


As of June 30th, this installs Docker 1.12RC2 and gets it setup with 2 nodes and 1 master, by just running `vagrant up`.   
 Once vagrant it finishes  just run `vagrant ssh master-1`, and the cluster is ready to go!
